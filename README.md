Sketch Split Shape
==============

A Sketch Plugin that divides a rectangle into a specified number of divisions equally.

## How it works

Create a rectangle the width and height of the area you want the grid to appear. Run the plugin and input the number of rows, columns and gutter between each item and hit OK. If the rectangle is within an artboard you can also specify margins which subtract the overall width of the object and center the rectangle divisions.
