Split Shape
==============

An improved version of Marceloeduardo's Sketch script [Split Into Grid](https://github.com/marceloeduardo/Sketch-Scripts).

## How it works

Create a rectangle the width and height of the area you want the grid to appear. Run the plugin and input the number of rows, columns and gutter between each item and hit OK.
